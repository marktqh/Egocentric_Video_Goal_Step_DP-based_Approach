# Video-Text Alignment with Contrastive Learning

This repository contains a dataset and a model for video-text alignment using a contrastive learning approach. The dataset consists of preprocessed video chunks and corresponding step descriptions, while the model uses positive and negative pairs to learn meaningful relationships between videos and text. The primary objective of this project is to match video chunks with the corresponding step descriptions by leveraging a contrastive loss technique.

## Introduction
This project tackles the problem of aligning video content with textual step descriptions by using contrastive learning. The dataset is divided into smaller video chunks and associated textual descriptions that define various steps in the video. The model is trained to learn the relationships between video chunks and their matching descriptions while distinguishing between unrelated pairs.

The approach aims to achieve the following:
- Learn a meaningful representation of video content and textual steps.
- Identify matching video chunks and their correct textual descriptions using a contrastive loss framework.
- The progress of this model will be used for the next step: a DP-based alignment technique that relies heavily on the quality of embeddings and similarities (**to be added**).

## Dataset
The dataset is stored in the form of individual video chunks (.pt files) and corresponding annotations.

- **Video Root Directory**: Each subfolder in the video root directory is named after the unique `video_uid`.
- **Video Chunks**: Video frames are divided into chunks (e.g., 4 frames per chunk for every 2 seconds) and stored as `.pt` files named `chunk_X.pt`.
- **Annotations File**: The dataset also includes a JSON file containing annotations, which consists of video UIDs, start and end times, and step descriptions for each segment.

## Model Overview
The model architecture for this project is designed to process video chunks and step descriptions through a contrastive learning approach.

- **Positive Pairs**: Each chunk of a video and its corresponding step description is treated as a positive pair.
- **Negative Pairs**: The model generates negative pairs by randomly pairing video chunks and step descriptions that do not correspond to each other.
- **Contrastive Loss**: The model utilizes InfoNCE contrastive loss to maximize similarity between positive pairs and minimize similarity between negative pairs.

## Installation
- The model is currently under development...

## Usage
- Will be updated after development phase

## Training
The model is trained using a custom DataLoader (`VideoTextAlignmentDataset`) which loads each video chunk along with the corresponding positive and negative pairs.

- **Batch Size**: Training is performed in batches, where each batch consists of multiple positive and negative pairs.
- **Negative Sampling**: Negative pairs are generated by selecting unrelated video chunks or step descriptions based on a specified negative sampling ratio.
- **Adaptive Learning Rate**: The model uses an adaptive learning rate scheduler to optimize performance during training.

## Inference
The actual performance of the model will be inferenced by applying an dp-based alignment technique to utilize the model's fine-tuned similarity score. The alignment score will be r@1 IoU = 0.3: for the top 1 predictions for each action, the percentage of them having IoU over 0.3.

- `train_lavila_adapters.py`: Defines the `VideoTextAlignmentDataset` class for data loading, and defines the main training loop.
- `evaluate.py`: This file will be updated after the end of the capstone project. Please contact for more details if interested.
- `lavila folder`: The original implementations for Lavila. Modified Lavila model still uses a lot of implementations from this folder.
